A sample for urban computing in big data course
KD-tree is utilized for range search and nearest search

Task description:
-Given 
  A sampled POI dataset in Shanghai
  Bing Map SDK which can  
    obtain the location of a point (e.g. the red star shown in the example)
    overlap information (including push-pins and lines) on a map
-Build a query-answer engine
  Two types of queries: KNN and spatial range query
  Using any indexing and retrieval algorithms taught in the course 
  Concerned with efficiency
  The query location, spatial range and category of POIs are variables 
-Build a simple interface that can
